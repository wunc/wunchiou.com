<h1>HTLA School Website</h1>
<h3>Site: <a href="http://www.ht-la.org">ht-la.org</a></h3>
<p>I designed and managed the High Tech Los Angeles Charter High School's website using the Drupal CMS with a custom-styled theme utilizing CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery for fluid and aesthetic user experience. I also supported school promotion and fundraising with email, donation, and event pages, HTML5 video, and a showcase of cool projects. (All that in addition to being a full-time science teacher.)</p>

<h1>HTLA POL Web App</h1>
<h3>Site: private (requires login)</h3>
<p>This school requires all students to do biannual Presentations of Learning (POLs) in front of a panel of judges. Since inception, the scoring and documentation of the POLs was done by hand on paper. To better facilitate scheduling, communication of scores to students and parents, and historical data analysis of student performance, I built a POL web-based app. The app back-end is coded in PHP with a MySQL database and LDAP authentication, while the front-end utilizes AJAX and HTML5-generated graphs. The app is very successful, and has been in regular use since 2011.</p>

<h1>Solar Car Project</h1>
<h3>Site: <a href="http://www.ht-la.org/solarcar/">ht-la.org/solarcar</a></h3>
<p>With generous grants, the school was able to create a 2-year class with the goal of building a solar car. At the conclusion of the class, I designed this website to showcase the process and the results of the solar car project. It features embedded photos and videos, and is built as a standalone site.</p>

<h1>Pop Day Election Event Web App</h1>
<h3>Site: private internal</h3>
<p>This web app was made to facilitate a mock 2012 election for the whole school, for an annual school-wide event called "Pop Day" (read more about it <a href="http://www.ht-la.org/showcase/pop-day">here</a>). The app allowed students to register to vote, affiliate with a political party, vote in primary and general elections, and vote on ballot propositions. It also featured real-time updating of election results. The app was coded with a PHP/MySQL back-end and extensive use of AJAX (with jQuery) in the interactive front-end, with a simple but modern flat UI design.</p>
